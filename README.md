# Kraken Bitcoin Profit Calculator

*Warning*: Because Kraken fees can change without notice at any time, this calculator may not be accurate.

## Description

This is a simple profit calculator for the casual long-term Bitcoin investor. As such, and unlike other calculators, it assumes that bitcoins are not left in the exchange, but rather transferred to a personal wallet.

A few assumptions are made that may not work for everybody:

- Once bought, bitcoins are withdrawn to a personal wallet, meaning that a withdrawal fee is charged
- Before selling, bitcoins are sent from the personal wallet back to Kraken, meaning that a transaction fee is charged
- Buy and sell orders are market orders, meaning that a taker fee is charged
- The 30-day trading volume is $0.00
- All deposit/withdrawal minimums are met

In particular, the following fee values are used:

- Taker order: 0.26%
- XBT withdrawal: ₿0.00015
- USD withdrawal (FedWire): $4.00
- EUR withdrawal (Fidor AG): €0.09
